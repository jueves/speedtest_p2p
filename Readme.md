This project uses data collected with [Ookla's Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/) cli app and adds time and p2p app status in the local network.

As most data was collected before developing this project, there is also a Python script to generate dummy dates and p2p statuses, while also replacing sensitive data about used servers.

You can see data exploration [here](https://github.com/jueves/speedtest_p2p/blob/master/speedtest.md).
